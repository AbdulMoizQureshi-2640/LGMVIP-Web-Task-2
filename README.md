## Code Overview

### HTML

The HTML file contains the structure of the to-do list web app, including the input field, add button, and the container for the task list.

### CSS

The CSS file styles the web app, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface. It includes styles for the input field, add button, task items, and background.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript file adds functionality to the web app, including adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks. It uses event listeners to handle user interactions and updates the DOM accordingly. It includes 2 phases one is that the tasks are stored in local storage which I comment due to hosting on github. If this project run on computer or PC then for the local storage the line 8 & 45 in script.js file should be uncomment  and line 11 will be commented.
